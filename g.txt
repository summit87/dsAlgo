//Warm up question:
Given a grid of size (N x N), cells S and T, impassable cells with water,
find if an S->T path exists, assuming we can only move horizontally/vertically.
No coding required, only explain how you would solve this problem.

// Main Question:
A mouse is trying to get from its starting position S to a target T.
The problem is that there is a sleeping cat C on the grid.
The closer the mouse approaches the cat, the higher the chance of
the cat to wake up. So, the mouse wants to get to T, staying as far
away as possible from the cat C.

Formally, assume again a square grid of size (N x N), allowing only
horizontal and vertical moves, impassable cells with water,
and cells S, T, and C. We want to find a path from S to T
for which the minimal distance to C along the path is maximal.

Example
........
.....S.
.C**.**
........
.......
.......
....T...

Output - 4
