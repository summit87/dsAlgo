• Consistency Models: Strong, eventual, causal.


𝟐. 𝐂𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠

• Client-side vs. Server-side Cache: Understand where caching should happen.
• Caching Strategies: Write-through, write-back, write-around.
• Distributed Cache: Redis, Memcached. 
• Cache Eviction Policies: LRU, LFU, etc.


𝟑. 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠

• Horizontal Scaling: Why and how to horizontally scale services.
• Load Balancing Techniques: Round-robin, consistent hashing.
• Reverse Proxy: Understand how to use Nginx, HAProxy.


𝟒. 𝐀𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠

• Message Brokers: Kafka, RabbitMQ. When to use queues vs. streams.
• Event-Driven Architecture: Benefits of decoupling and event sourcing.
